# UK HPI (House Price Index) Analysis - Python
Data Analytics Project about the evolution of the house prices in the UK by Javier Sanchez Agesta

## Objective

This repository contains the analysis of the house prices' evoloution across the different regions in the UK from 1995 till present, based on the sale prices of all the different kind of homes and differentiating by old, new, detached, semi-detached, terraced, or flat, as well as if it has been sold by mortgage or cash. 

Through the project we will try to find out what is the trend of the price sales, if there is stationarity and if there is any other factors that affect the prices of the houses, as well as if those factors are common to the different types of living spaces. 

## Data

The data set contains information about the following: 

- Average selling price for the sold houses in the UK from 1965 to 2021. The houses are divided by features such as old, new, detached, semi-detaced, terraced, flat, mortgage/ cash as payment method.
- Index for each of the years and locations.

The full details of the data are available [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-december-2021)

## Tools 

For this project the following Python libraries were used:

-	Pandas - for data analysis

-	Seaborn - for visualization

- Matplotlib - for visualizations

- Sklearn - for k-means algorithms

- Datetime - for time series data
 
## Folders contents

The repository is divided in 4 sections, defined as follows:

1. Project Management: Data Project brief document containing information and descriptions of main aspects of our analysis, such as 'Objective', 'Context', 'Data requirements', 'Analysis criteria', 'Dashboard requirements' and 'Project deliverables'

2. Data: folder containing the pieces of data used for this project, as well as the ones resulting after cleaning and wrangling.

3. Scripts: this folder contains the Jupyter notebooks created for this analysis, including cleaning and wrangling the data, consistency checks,  subsetting and creating new variables, data visualization, time series analysis, and machine learning realted processes.

4. Analysis - Visualizations: in this folder we can find the main visualizations produced through the analysis with Seaborn and maplotlib.
